<p><strong>About Us</strong>
</p>
<p>GeoWorks is Southeast Asia’s first geospatial industry centre, operated
by the Singapore Land Authority. As an industry centre, it aims to foster
a vibrant geospatial ecosystem in Singapore and beyond – bringing together
geospatial businesses such as MNCs, scale-ups and government agencies to
promote business growth, drive innovation and build a diverse, well-connected
geospatial community.</p>
<p>GeoWorks also runs regular training sessions, partner and community events.
GeoWorks' key event is Singapore Geospatial Festival. First organised successfully
in 2019, GeoWorks continues to organise this event in Sep/Oct every year.
