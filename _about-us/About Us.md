**About Us**

GeoWorks is Southeast Asia’s first geospatial industry centre, operated by the Singapore Land Authority. As an industry centre, it aims to foster a vibrant geospatial ecosystem in Singapore and beyond – bringing together geospatial businesses such as MNCs, scale-ups and government agencies to promote business growth, drive innovation and build a diverse, well-connected geospatial community.

GeoWorks also runs regular training sessions, partner and community events. GeoWorks' key event is Singapore Geospatial Festival. First organised successfully in 2019, GeoWorks continues to organise this event in Sep/Oct every year. Find out more about the 2023 edition [here](https://www.sla.gov.sg/programmes/sggeofest/).
