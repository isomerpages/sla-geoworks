<p><strong>GeoEngage 2025: Socio-Healthcare Edition</strong>
</p>
<p>In October, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) organised GeoEngage 2025:
Socio-Healthcare Edition, which brought together over 170 participants
from government, academia, and the social-healthcare sector to explore
how geospatial insights can enhance social service delivery and strengthen
community care.</p>
<p>From the Living Asset Map that supports social prescribing to Barrier-Free
Access Routing that enables inclusive mobility, this year‚Äôs event highlighted
how geospatial tools can help us plan smarter, connect better, and create
a more inclusive society.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a round-up of what went down on 7 and 8 October! üëá</p>
<p><strong>Setting the Stage with Innovation üí°</strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúEach of you here is a trailblazer ‚Äì showing how geospatial can be used
in practical, meaningful ways to build stronger, healthier communities.‚Äù</p>
<p>With this inspiring opening message, our Acting Assistant Chief Executive
(ACE) Benjamin Chan set the stage for two days of learning, sharing, and
collaboration</p>

invited students from Singapore‚Äôs IHLs to reimagine how OneMap and geospatial
insights could address real-world socio-healthcare issues.</p>
<p>These student projects demonstrate how geospatial technologies can be
harnessed to build stronger, healthier, and more inclusive communities.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ReMind: Supporting Dementia &amp; Community-Assisted Eldercare</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The top prize went to Team 1 from Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</strong>.
The team developed a mobile app, <strong>ReMind</strong>, that uses OneMap‚Äôs
geospatial data for real-time tracking and routing of seniors who may wander
from their safe zones. The app alerts caregivers when individuals move
beyond designated areas and guide them via the fastest route to locate
them. <strong>ReMind </strong>also mobilises nearby community responders
to locate and share sightings of missing persons, guiding them to Dementia
Go-to Points on OneMap and forming a community-centric safety network.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp; <strong>Purposeful Event: Gamifying Wellness for Active Ageing by Institute of Technical Education (ITE)</strong>
</p>
<p>The team‚Äôs prototype, <strong>Purposeful Event</strong>, encourages seniors
to remain socially and physically active by connecting them to nearby community
activities through a gamified OneMap interface. By blending geospatial
mapping with behavioural design, Purposeful Event helps create more connected,
active, and inclusive communities for seniors.</p>
