invited students from Singapore‚Äôs IHLs to reimagine how OneMap and geospatial
insights could address real-world socio-healthcare issues.</p>
<p>These student projects demonstrate how geospatial technologies can be
harnessed to build stronger, healthier, and more inclusive communities.</p>
<p><strong>ReMind: Supporting Dementia &amp; Community-Assisted Eldercare</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The top prize went to Team 1 from Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</strong>.
The team developed a mobile app, <strong>ReMind</strong>, that uses OneMap‚Äôs
geospatial data for real-time tracking and routing of seniors who may wander
from their safe zones. The app alerts caregivers when individuals move
beyond designated areas and guide them via the fastest route to locate
them. <strong>ReMind </strong>also mobilises nearby community responders
to locate and share sightings of missing persons, guiding them to Dementia
Go-to Points on OneMap and forming a community-centric safety network</p>

<p>Other Participating Teams (<em>not in order of merit</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Purposeful Event: Gamifying Wellness for Active Ageing by Institute of Technical Education (ITE)</strong>
</p>
<p>The team‚Äôs prototype, <strong>Purposeful Event</strong>, encourages seniors
to remain socially and physically active by connecting them to nearby community
activities through a gamified OneMap interface. By blending geospatial
mapping with behavioural design, <strong>Purposeful Event</strong> helps
create more connected, active, and inclusive communities for seniors.</p>
<p><strong>CareLink: Targeted Aid Distribution &amp; Outreach for Vulnerable Communities by Singapore Institute of Management (SIM)</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2024, Singapore generated 784,000 tonnes of food waste, even as some
households continued to experience food insecurity. The team‚Äôs prototype, <strong>CareLink</strong>,<strong> </strong>bridges
this gap through OneMap that links local mini-marts and shops with residents
in need, especially among elderly residents and low-income families. The
system visualises areas of higher food insecurity, enabling community organisations
to plan more efficient and equitable outreach. By combining sustainability
and social support, <strong>CareLink </strong>turns waste reduction into
a community-driven aid network, using <strong>geospatial intelligence</strong> to
match surplus to need.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VapeWatch: Geospatial Insights to Identify and Respond to Emerging Vaping Hotspots By Singapore Management University (SMU)</strong>
</p>
<p>With vaping cases rising to&nbsp;2,500 in just the first half of 2025,
the team designed <strong>VapeWatch, </strong>which demonstrates how&nbsp;geospatial
intelligence&nbsp;can be used to strengthen public health surveillance,
enforcement, and youth outreach. <strong>VapeWatch</strong> serves as a connected
ecosystem linking&nbsp;citizens, enforcement agencies, outreach workers,
and community partners&nbsp;through a shared geospatial data platform.
Citizens can submit anonymous vaping incident reports through a mobile
app, verified by AI-based photo recognition to improve reliability, while
officers can access an&nbsp;operational dashboard&nbsp;with incident maps,
temporal pattern analysis, and&nbsp;AI-generated patrol recommendations,
to identify hotspots and optimise resource deployment.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Insights that Inspired üí¨</strong>
</p>
<p>Across both days, we heard from experts in the socio-healthcare space
who shared how geospatial insights are helping them better understand and
serve communities.</p>
<p><strong>Ageing and Social Networks: Mapping the Life-Worlds of Older Singaporeans</strong>
</p>
<p>Professor Elaine Ho from the National University of Singapore (NUS) shared
her research findings, which reshapes how we think about active ageing
in Singapore. Through survey data and compelling case studies, her work

<p>Ms Aileen Tan, Director of Capability Implementation and Digitalisation
Strategy at the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), outlined the
digital transformation roadmap for Singapore's social service sector. Through
compelling use cases, she illustrated how technology can revolutionise
service delivery while building organisational capabilities. NCSS's presentation
served as both inspiration and practical guidance, encouraging social service
agencies to embrace digitalisation and develop the technical expertise
needed to better serve their communities in an increasingly connected world.</p>
<p><strong>CARA - a Location-Enabled Lifestyle and Digital Community Platform</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Bernard Lim, Director of Advocacy &amp; Communications at the Dementia
Singapore, introduced CARA - the organisation‚Äôs lifestyle and digital community
platform, that's transforming dementia care through innovative location
technology. This solution harnesses location intelligence to safely trace
missing dementia patients while maintaining a detailed map of over 800
dementia Go-To-Points (GTP) across Singapore. The platform's GTP locator
feature empowers users to quickly identify the nearest support touchpoints,
where specially trained staff stand ready to assist persons with dementia,
creating a city-wide safety network that provides peace of mind for families
and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Assistive Augmentations ‚Äì Fundamentally Transforming Human Ability</strong>
</p>
<p>Professor Suranga Nanayakkara, Vice Dean (Communications), School of Computing
at the National University of Singapore (NUS), showcased AiSee, an intelligent
visual assistant, which is a wearable conversational companion that helps
blind and low vision people to access information on the go. The device
works by analysing images seen through a built-in camera and giving information
about the object to the user through a verbal prompt. By combining assistive
technologies with geospatial capabilities, AiSee empowers visually impaired
users to navigate the world with greater confidence and independence, turning
everyday environments into accessible, information-rich spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Conversations that Mapped the Way Forward üåç</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Panel Discussion on Day One: Mapping Better Care Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>Moderated by Mr Lim Liyang, Deputy Director (Geospatial &amp; Data) at
SLA, the panel brought together voices from across sectors ‚Äì Prof. Elaine
Ho (NUS), Mr Kelvin Koh (MINDS), Mr Dominic Lim (AIC), and Mr Yet Tun Hoong
(VCS) ‚Äì for an afternoon of lively and thought-provoking discussion.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üí° <strong>Impact of Geospatial in Socio-Healthcare: </strong>Speakers
shared on the most significant impact that geospatial has made in their
work, such as the use of geospatial data and insights which reveal the
actual needs of the older adults - they thrive well when supported by community-wide
networks rather than being confined to traditional residential-based care
models.</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üí° <strong>Addressing Clients‚Äô Challenges: </strong>The
journey into geospatial technology began with a simple but telling observation:
clients were travelling unnecessarily long distances to access services,
often bypassing closer alternatives. This realisation sparked the development
of mapping solutions that now help clients easily identify their nearest
service centres, dramatically reducing travel burdens and making support
more accessible to those who need it most.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Panel Discussion on Day Two: Digital Transformation in Social Services: Building Inclusive Communities</strong>
</p>
<p>Moderated by Mr Tan Guo Jun, Deputy Director (Geospatial &amp; Data) at
SLA, the panel brought together voices from across sectors ‚Äì Mr Bernard
Lim (Dementia Singapore), Prof. Suranga Nanayakkara (NUS), Ms Aileen Tan
(NCSS), and Mr Cai Shaojun (RoamAssist) ‚Äì for an afternoon of lively and
thought-provoking discussion.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üí° <strong>Putting people first:</strong> The
panel explored how technology can foster inclusivity when designed around
real human needs ‚Äì and introduced to communities gradually through a phased
approach.</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üí° <strong>Empowering the social sector:</strong> Beyond
tech professionals, speakers emphasised that those in the social service
space can also be technologists in their own right, by picking up digital
skills and weaving them into their daily work.</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üí° <strong>Design for everyone:</strong> For
technological adoption to be viable in the long run, solutions should be
designed to benefit a wider audience ‚Äì for example, a robotic guide dog
need not only to assist the visually impaired, but could also serve general
wayfinding and guidance needs for anyone in need.</p>
<p>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üí° <strong>Collaboration is key:</strong> The
discussion wrapped up with a call for deeper partnerships across academia,
industry, and the social service sector ‚Äì because building an inclusive
digital ecosystem takes all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Hands-On Learning, From Classroom to Field üéí</strong>
</p>
<p>Participants also got to roll up their sleeves in two interactive workshops!</p>
<p>Day one‚Äôs Geospatialisation Workshop provided a fun introduction to location-based
intelligence, with real-world use cases and group discussions that showcased
how geospatial tools can drive impact in the social sector.</p>
<p>In day two‚Äôs GeoAdventure Workshop, participants got to experience how
geospatial technology connects to our daily lives first-hand ‚Äì with a foray
outdoors! They ventured into the heartlands to ‚Äòcollect‚Äô points of interest
using the Survey123 app, and then watched their data come alive on a map
back at Revenue House.</p>
<p>By the end of GeoEngage 2025, one thing was clear ‚Äì geospatial technology
is not just about data and maps. It‚Äôs about improving lives, enabling care,
and mapping a better future for all.</p>
