<p><strong>GeoEngage 2025: Socio-Healthcare Edition</strong>
</p>
<p>In October, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) organised GeoEngage 2025:
Socio-Healthcare Edition, which brought together over 170 participants
from government, academia, and the social-healthcare sector to explore
how geospatial insights can enhance social service delivery and strengthen
community care.</p>
<p>From the Living Asset Map that supports social prescribing to Barrier-Free
Access Routing that enables inclusive mobility, this year’s event highlighted
how geospatial tools can help us plan smarter, connect better, and create
a more inclusive society.</p>
<p>Here’s a round-up of what went down on 7 and 8 October! 👇</p>
<p><strong>Setting the Stage with Innovation 💡</strong>
</p>
<p>“Each of you here is a trailblazer – showing how geospatial can be used
in practical, meaningful ways to build stronger, healthier communities.”</p>
<p>With this inspiring opening message, our Acting Assistant Chief Executive
(ACE) Benjamin Chan set the stage for two days of learning, sharing, and
collaboration.</p>
