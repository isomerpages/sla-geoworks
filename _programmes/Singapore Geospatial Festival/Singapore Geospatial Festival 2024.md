<p>Organised by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), with the Maritime and
Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) as a Supporting Partner, the theme for

which highlights the transformative impact of geospatial technology on
social good and youth education.</p>
<p>The event brought together the geospatial community (public and private
sectors as well as the community-at-large) for talks, panel discussions,
workshops and co-located activities.</p>
<p>The 3-day festival from 15 - 17 October was attended by close to 700 participants.</p>
