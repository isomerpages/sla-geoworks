<p>Organised by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), with the Maritime and
Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) as a Supporting Partner, the theme for
Singapore Geospatial Festival (SG GeoFest) was “<strong><em>Geospatial for Good: Enriching Minds, Empowering Lives</em></strong>”,
which highlights the transformative impact of geospatial technology on
social good and youth education.</p>
<p>The event brought together the geospatial community (public and private
sectors as well as the community-at-large) for talks, panel discussions,
workshops and co-located activities.</p>
<p>The 3-day festival from 15 - 17 October was attended by close to 650 participants.</p>
<h2>Opening Session</h2>
<p>The opening session of SG GeoFest 2024 was kicked off with the Opening
Address by Mr Yeoh Oon Jin, Chairman of SLA. In his remarks, Mr Yeoh outlined
the refreshed Singapore Geospatial Master Plan and its 3 key pillars -
Mainstreaming, Deepening Capabilities, and Going Global. He highlighted
initiatives such as social prescribing with SingHealth Community Hospitals,
Barrier-Free Access efforts with OneMap, and projects with IRAS and MPA
on property tax and climate mitigation as examples of utilising Geospatial
for Good.</p>

<h2>Industry Keynotes</h2>
<p>We were honored to welcome Mr David Foo, Assistant Chief Executive (Operations
and Ops-Tech) / Chief Data Officer from the Maritime and Port Authority
of Singapore (MPA), as he delivered the first industry keynote. His keynote
highlighted the crucial role of marine geospatial information in safeguarding
our coastlines and environment, and that MPA and SLA are expanding the
SiReNT GNSS network to improve monitoring of vertical land motion, crucial
for accurate sea-level rise projections.</p>
