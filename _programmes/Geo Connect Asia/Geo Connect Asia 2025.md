<p>The <strong>fifth edition</strong> of <strong>Geo Connect Asia 2025</strong> commenced
with an opening ceremony led by Mr Yeoh Oon Jin, Chairman of Singapore
Land Authority (SLA) and Mr Rupert Owen, Co-Founder of Geo Connect Asia.
Following welcome remarks by Mr Rupert Owen, Mr Yeoh announced the official
expansion of two key initiatives: the Living Asset MaP (LAMP) and Barrier-Free-Access
(BFA).</p>
<p><strong>Living Asset MaP (LAMP) expanding to more precints across Singapore</strong>
</p>

<p></p>
<p>Living Asset MaP (LAMP) is a community-centric initiative co-developed
by SLA and SingHealth Community Hospitals, and supported by the MOH Office
for Healthcare Transformation to enable social prescribing. From its pilot
in Sengkang, LAMP is now expanding to more precincts across Singapore,
connecting more seniors to local activities and services which will enable
them to stay active and engaged, improving their overall health and wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion of Barrier-Free-Access Mapping from Outdoor to Indoor</strong>
</p>
<p>Barrier-Free-Access (BFA) initiative was started with an aim to help wheelchair
users move around Singapore more easily. What began with 1,000 km of accessible
paths in nine areas including Bukit Merah, Ang Mo Kio and Orchard now has
an additional 5,000 km of barrier-free routes being mapped across Singapore.
Clementi, West Coast and the National University of Singapore campus were
among the latest areas added to OneMap BFA. This initiative is further
strengthened through a tripartite MOU signed in November 2024 between SLA,
the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore (REDAS) and SG Enable,
which aims to extend BFA mapping from outdoor routes to indoor spaces including
shopping malls, creating a seamless navigation experience.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Joins Global Efforts to Boost Land Motion and Climate Monitoring Efforts</strong>
</p>
<p>SLA officially signed a Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMOU)
with the United Nations Global Geodetic Centre of Excellence (UN-GGCE)
and close to 40 participating member states and organisations—uniting efforts
to strengthen global geodetic infrastructure that underpins critical positioning,
navigation and timing services worldwide.</p>
<p>This collaboration supports Singapore’s vision of being a safe, sustainable,
and smart nation—enabling smarter climate monitoring, coastal protection
strategies, and future-ready infrastructure development.</p>
<p>While rising sea levels have dominated climate discourse, land motion—especially
subsidence—remains an often-overlooked factor. Without long-term land motion
data, we risk underestimating the real extent of climate vulnerabilities,
particularly for a low-lying, highly urbanised island state like Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, SLA is embarking on the first nationwide compilation of long-term
land motion data. This foundational geospatial initiative will support
key agencies like Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), PUB,
Singapore's National Water Agency, and Centre for Climate Research Singapore
in predictive and preventive climate resilience planning. It will also
inform the monitoring of infrastructure stability, settlement of reclaimed
land, and impacts from underground construction.</p>
<p>The MMOU reflects Singapore’s bold commitment to international cooperation,
and ensures that we have the tools, data and partnerships needed to build
long-term urban and climate resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibition Tour by SLA Chairman</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Yeoh and delegates also toured the exhibition, starting with SLA’s
booth featuring its initiatives and products including Barrier-Free Access,
LAMP, Digital Underground, the National 3D Mapping Programme, and SiReNT
– Singapore’s national satellite positioning infrastructure. The delegation
then visited the Thailand and Sabah Pavilions, and concluded with showcases
by a few prominent leading companies.</p>
<p><strong>Panel: Geo + Augmented Intelligence: Transforming Data into Actionable Insights</strong>
</p>
<p>On Day 1 of Geo Connect Asia 2025, a panel featuring</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Prof. Wu Chen</strong>, Head LSGI, ADoRIAIoT &amp; Chair Professor
of Satellite Navigation of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dr Will Cavendish</strong>, Director, Global Digital Services
Leader of Arup,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mr Chris Mawer</strong>, Chief Digital Officer of Huawei International</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>with <strong>Mr Ng Siau Yong</strong>, Director, GeoSpatial and Data &amp;
Chief Data Officer of SLA as moderator, unpacked how geospatial intelligence,
AI, and open data are shaping the future.</p>
<p>"The issue isn’t data scarcity—it’s data quality," said Mr Ng, as he opened
the discussion on the urgent need for usable, integrated insights in today’s
decision-making.</p>
<p>"Real-world AI isn’t about clean datasets—it’s training models to thrive
in messy, complex realities," opined Dr Cavendish, who shared how AI is
helping cities balance cost and reduce carbon footprint, and even repurpose
ageing buildings with vibration and noise analysis.</p>
<p>Prof Chen spotlighted Hong Kong’s spatial data infrastructure, enabling
tools like LLMs to assess road planning and environmental impact.</p>
<p>Mr Mawer called for open-source formats to fuel innovation, as the panel
closed with a rallying cry to geospatial professionals: don’t silo your
data— collaborate and blend it to solve global challenges!</p>
<p><strong>Digital Underground Connect 2025 (DUConnect)</strong>
<br>
<br>At Digital Underground Connect 2025, more than 20 experts came together
across four dynamic panels to explore the untapped potential of Singapore’s
subsurface. The conversations underscored a clear vision: building a smarter,
safer, and more sustainable city starts with understanding what’s underground.
<br>
<br>Strong public-private partnerships and reliable underground data are key
to shaping an accurate digital twin of our underground spaces. By breaking
down silos and sharing up-to-date information, we can transform buried
infrastructure into a collective asset—supporting better decision-making,
reducing risks, and unlocking new possibilities for urban innovation.
<br>
<br>Powerful ideas and partnerships emerged at DUConnect 2025—we’re just beginning
to dig into the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Asian Aerial Mapping Forum 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>While one forum took us deep into the Digital Underground, the other had
us gazing skyward during the inaugural Asian Aerial Mapping Forum.
<br>
</p>
<p>From the first aerial photo snapped via hot air balloon in 1858 to today’s
AI-enhanced LiDAR scans and drone imagery, aerial mapping has become a
cornerstone of urban digital twins. It’s the birds-eye foundation that
lets us capture building geometries, terrain features and infrastructure
with pinpoint accuracy.</p>
<p>The forum brought together a stellar panel of experts across industry,
academia, and the public sector, offering fresh insights, best practices,
and novel applications that show how these "eye-in-the-sky" technologies
are transforming how we plan our urban future in the areas of land and
infrastructure management, resource optimisation, and environmental monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Plenary: Mainstreaming Geospatial for Good: From Niche to Necessity</strong>
</p>
<p>The Geo Connect Asia 2025 concluded with an expert panel discussion where
speakers unpacked what it takes to scale geospatial solutions that are
inclusive, impactful, and future-ready. Discussion topics included solution
scalability, social impact initiatives, cross-sector collaboration, technological
advancement, and talent development strategies.</p>
