<p><strong>Panel Discussions</strong>
<br>
<br>SLA also took to the stage at Geo Connect Asia&nbsp;on 6 March 2024, steering
two insightful panel discussions that delved into the future of public
health and urban development using geospatial innovation and solutions.
<br>
<br>First up was the opening panel on the importance of location in improving
life quality, moderated by Director of Geospatial &amp; Data, Mr Ng Siau
Yong. The panel explored a range of issues, including using maps to streamline
the planning of public health services, alongside the complexities of predicting
what users need based on where and how old they are.</p>

<p>The second panel moderated by Director of Survey &amp; Geomatics, Dr Victor
Khoo, delved into the optimisation and integration of Urban Digital Twins,
which has emerged as a critical tool for future city development and management.
The panellists dissected the benefits of using digital twins to better
plan and manage our cities and discussed its potential integration with
other smart city technologies. At the same time, they raised questions
about their effectiveness in supporting sustainable city solutions and
whether they are the solution to connect better with our communities.</p>
