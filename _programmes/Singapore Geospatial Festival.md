Organised by GeoWorks, Singapore Land Authority’s geospatial industry centre, the theme for Singapore Geospatial Festival (SG GeoFest) this year was “Geospatial: Enriching Minds, Empowering Lives”. The event brought the international geospatial community (public and private sectors as well as the community-at-large) together for talks, panel discussions, workshops and co-located activities promoting the innovative use of geospatial information and technology. Graced by Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman, Minister, Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Education and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs for its opening session, the week-long festival from 26 – 29 September was attended by more than 700 local and overseas participants.  


OGC Member Meeting 2023
-----------------------

In tandem with SG GeoFest 2023, we are pleased to have hosted the 127th Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Member Meeting here in Singapore once again.

OGC is dedicated to advancing the future of geospatial through open standards and technologies. It is always an honour to host such an experienced and accomplished community of experts with us in Singapore.

Enriching Minds, Empowering Lives
---------------------------------

This year, the theme of SG GeoFest is “Enriching Minds, Empowering Lives”. There are two parts to this theme.

In SLA’s Chief Executive, Mr Colin Low’s Opening Address, he said: First, ‘Enriching Minds’. Over the past ten years, I am sure that all of us have observed a clear surge in the usage of geospatial data, information, and technology. To meet this growing demand, it is therefore crucial to build a talent pipeline to nurture national geospatial capabilities. There is a saying that ‘learning never ends’, which I fully agree with. Geospatial-related content must be included across the full spectrum of the education journey, from our youth to working professionals. Here at SLA, we have been actively working towards this goal.

The second part of our theme is ‘Empowering Lives’. Apart from building up our national geospatial capabilities, geospatial is an integral tool that can be used to improve and enhance our daily lives.” Rather than just reading sterile textbooks, students can now see and experience points of historical, social, or cultural value for themselves through immersive learning. Other than education, geospatial has also demonstrated its immense value in our everyday lives, whether it may be routing paths to the nearest neighbourhood amenities or locating nearby ART kits during the pandemic.

SLA’s goal, as the national geospatial agency, is to empower the next generation with the geospatial skills and competencies they need to thrive in an increasingly inter-connected and complex world. This year’s Festival stands as a testament to the power of geospatial in enlivening education and sparking curiosity in learning.
